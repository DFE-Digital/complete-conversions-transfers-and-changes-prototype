      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Iterating the task list and adding the project 
      information tab</h1>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Task list changes following user research</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We began the next set of changes to the prototype by 
      acting on some of the feedback we got during the user research.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This included:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li> Status tasks to reflect a task's status - these now show if a task
            is yet to set, is in progress or is completed  </li>
          <li> Explicitly refer to Regional Delivery Officers in handover task questions
            - this should improve clarity for users, avoiding confusion with Operational 
            Delivery Team Delivery Officers (our users)</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Name changes throughout the division</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">There have been multiple changes to areas of the department, 
        the group and the division we and our users belong to.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">There have also been changes to the name of the team our users 
        work in, and their job titles.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This has meant we've made changes in the prototype to reflect 
        this.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The team our users are part of has changes from Operational Delivery
        Team to Regional Casework Services.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our users' job titles have changed from Delivery officers to Caseworkers.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Preparing versions of the handover process for user research</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">To help us continue testing and iterating the task list and the actions
        users take to complete those tasks, we created an alternative version of the handover task.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This removed unnecessary questions and listed all the relevant questions
        on one page, rather than one question per page.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Preparing the project information tab for user research</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Following discussions with some of the caseworkers, we were able to get more 
        information about what they needed from a project information tab.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The idea of a project information tab was something that had been included
        in the Figma screens.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This contained all the background information about the project, including
        contact details, SharePoint file locations and school type.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We wanted to start investigating more about how useful that was, and what
        information in it was most useful.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Document journeys</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We also built journeys for checking and clearing legal documents and other
        files needed to progress the conversion.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This included:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Local authority questionnaire</li>
          <li>Conversion grant</li>
          <li>Non-legal documents</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Testing the prototype with users</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">In this research we wanted to do two things:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>check users understood the project information concept</li>
        <li>discover what information should be in the project information tab</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We asked users to navigate from the project list to 
        a project, view the tasks in the handover section, then view the project 
        information page.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Then, we asked users to do an open card sort to identify 
        the information they need to know when they first start a project.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Research findings</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">From that research, we found:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Some language didn't match with how case workers refer to things. We had used "old URN" and "new URN". Caseworks refer to them as "URN" and "Academy's URN"</li>
        <li>Caseworkers were positive about the project information tab. They liked that it contains all the information they need to know when they start a project, in one place</li>
        <li>There were some concerns over the source of the information, and how accurate it would be</li>
        <li>There are some inconsistencies in the handover process. The product, or process changes, could resolve these issues</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will use these findings to inform the next round of changes we make to the task list.</p>
